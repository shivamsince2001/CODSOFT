# CODSOFT   # CODSOFT Internship - C++ Projects 💻

This repository contains all the tasks I completed during my **CodSoft C++ Internship**. Each project is console-based, beginner-friendly, and built using basic C++ concepts like loops, functions, arrays, strings, and conditionals.

## 🔹 Task List

### 1️⃣ Number Guessing Game (`numberguessing.cpp`)
A simple game where the computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess it. Feedback is provided on whether the guess is too high or too low until the correct number is guessed.

### 2️⃣ Calculator (`calculator.cpp`)
A console-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user inputs two numbers and chooses the operation.

### 3️⃣ Tic-Tac-Toe (`tictactoe.cpp`)
A 2-player console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game using a 3x3 grid. Players take turns as 'X' and 'O'. The program checks for a win or a draw after each move and allows playing again.

### 4️⃣ To-Do List Manager (`todolist.cpp`)
This program allows users to manage daily tasks. Users can:
- Add tasks
- View tasks (with status: Pending/Completed)
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks

### 5️⃣ Library Management System (`librarymanagement.cpp`)
A basic library system to manage books, borrowing, and returns. Features include:
- Add/search books by title, author, or ISBN
- Checkout and return books
- Fine calculation for overdue books
- Status update on book availability
